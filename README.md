# What's Open for macOS

A revival of the "What's Open" app for macOS, now working on Catalina (64 bit)

This project is based on version 2.1 from Sourceforge at https://sourceforge.net/projects/whatsopen/

I, Thomas Tempelmann, have received permission from the original author, Franklin Marmon, to re-release the program on my website at http:apps.tempel.org

This is the complete source code, minus the Sparkle signature keys.

If you find issues with the program, please use the Issues tracker here on github to report them.
